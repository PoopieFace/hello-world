# hello-world
My 1st Repo
This is my 1st attempt at learning C++. My 1st project will be a Windows application to read 1 second cycle ASCII magnetometer data from a 24 hour file, pick start and end times, and print the data graphically to a file, .pdf or .jpg. This is a huge task for a newbie but it will hopefully get me learning quickly!
